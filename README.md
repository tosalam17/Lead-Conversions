# Lead Conversion Prediction

This project builds a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a potential lead will be converted into a customer. The dataset includes features related to user engagement, demographics, and lead interaction history.

## ðŸš€ Objective
To help businesses prioritize high-potential leads by predicting conversion likelihood using classification algorithms.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes the following types of features:
- User activity metrics (e.g., time spent, number of visits)
- Source of the lead (e.g., Google, Direct)
- Demographic info (e.g., education, occupation)
- Conversion labels (binary)

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution plots
  - Correlation matrix
  - Target imbalance checks
- **Model Building**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC curve

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved a high-performing classification model with strong precision and recall, useful for identifying leads with high conversion potential.
